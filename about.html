            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm a dual-degree graduate student, pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, and a Master of Science in Computational and Applied Mathematics at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF).</p>
            <p>My passion for applied problem-solving and collaborative research has been honed throughout my academic and professional journey. Currently, I am working on ODE Modeling in Mathematical Oncology under the guidance of my undergraduate advisor, Dr. Heyrim Cho at UCR & ASU as well as PDE Modeling in Mathematical Oncology under Dr. Russell Rockne & Dr. Sergio Branciamore at the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope. I'm also a Quantum Software TA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Beaver Works Summer Institute! </p>
            <p>I've had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professionals, including Dr. Yat Tin Chow, Dr. Allen P. Mills, and Dr. Alexander S. Malinick. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (Applied Mathematics and Chemistry) from UC Riverside, which I earned in 2024. Prior to that, I graduated from Diamond Bar High School in 2020. As my portfolio is being developed, I look forward to conversing with peers and mentors to gain insight into how diversity plays an impactful role in daily life. I am eager to learn from industry leaders and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of innovation and progress. </p>
