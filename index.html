    <h1>Michelle L. Wu</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm a dual-degree graduate student, pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, and a Master of Science in Computational and Applied Mathematics at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF).
        My passion for applied problem-solving and collaborative research has been honed throughout my academic and professional journey. Currently, I am working on ODE Modeling in Mathematical Oncology under the guidance of my undergraduate advisor, Dr. Heyrim Cho at UCR & ASU as well as PDE Modeling in Mathematical Oncology under Dr. Russell Rockne & Dr. Sergio Branciamore at the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope. I'm also a Quantum Software TA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Beaver Works Summer Institute! 
        I've had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professionals, including Dr. Yat Tin Chow, Dr. Allen P. Mills, and Dr. Alexander S. Malinick. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (Applied Mathematics and Chemistry) from UC Riverside, which I earned in 2024. Prior to that, I graduated from Diamond Bar High School in 2020. As my portfolio is being developed, I look forward to conversing with peers and mentors to gain insight into how diversity plays an impactful role in daily life. I am eager to learn from industry leaders and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of innovation and progress. </p>
